Challenge Project: Appointment Planner

In this project, I used functional React components to create an app that manages contacts and appointments. 
The app consists of two pages: one to view and add contacts and one to view and add appointments.

Setup Instructions
Make sure you have Node installed on your computer, and then, inside the project’s root directory, run npm install.
Finally, run npm start, which will automatically open up a new tab in your browser with your running application. If a new tab does not appear, you can visit http://localhost:3000/.
